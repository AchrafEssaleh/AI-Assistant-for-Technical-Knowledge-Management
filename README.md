## Ongoing Project 
This repository hosts an ongoing academic–industrial project carried out during the second semester of the General Engineering Program at IMT Atlantique (2025–2026). The project is developed in collaboration with SOLENTand focuses on building an AI-powered knowledge management assistant.
Our goal is to design and implement a centralized platform that leverages local LLMs, RAG pipelines, and multi-format ingestion to:

## streamline onboarding of new team members,
## enable intelligent root-cause analysis,
## ensure traceability of technical documentation,
## and continuously enrich a collaborative knowledge base.
